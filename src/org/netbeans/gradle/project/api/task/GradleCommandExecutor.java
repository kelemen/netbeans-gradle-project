/**
 * Defines an executor which is able to execute Gradle commands. The commands
 * are executed on a background thread. Note that there is a limit on how much
 * task might be executed concurrently. This limit is currently set to 10 but
 * may be increased in the future.
 * <P>
 * This API does not currently allow for cancellation because as of now Gradle
 * does not support canceling command execution. When Gradle will support
 * cancellation a new executor might be added to the project's lookup.
 * <P>
 * This executor is available on the
 * {@link org.netbeans.api.project.Project#getLookup() project's lookup}. It is
 * already available when loading extensions (i.e., maybe retrieved in the
 * {@link org.netbeans.gradle.project.api.entry.GradleProjectExtensionQuery#loadExtensionForProject(org.netbeans.api.project.Project) GradleProjectExtensionQuery.loadExtensionForProject}
 * method.
