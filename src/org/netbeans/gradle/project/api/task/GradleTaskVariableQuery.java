/**
 * Defines a query which is able to retrieve variable mapping used to replace
 * strings when executing Gradle tasks. Variables might be used in task names,
 * task arguments or JVM arguments of the executed Gradle tasks. Variables in
 * strings take the form "${variable-name}". For example a built-in variable is
 * "project", so writing "${project}:run" will be replaced with ":MyProject:run",
 * assuming that the name of the project is ":MyProject".
 * <P>
 * Instances of this interface are expected to be found on the
 * {@link org.netbeans.gradle.project.api.entry.GradleProjectExtension#getExtensionLookup() lookup of the extension}.
 * The actions in the context menu might may have their own visualization by
 * implementing the {@code Presenter.Popup} interface (e.g., they can have
 * submenus).
 * <P>
 * Instances of this interface are required to be safe to be accessed by
 * multiple threads concurrently.
